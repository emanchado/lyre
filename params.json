  "body": "Say that you are a storyteller and you want an easy way to integrate images and music in your story. Especially if you like interactive stories (think \"role-playing games\"), Lyre can help you do it.\r\n\r\nThe basic premise is this: first, the narrator uploads the images she wants to show, grouped in scenes, and the audio tracks she wants to play, grouped in playlists. Right before telling the story, the narrator opens Lyre's narration page in her own computer and the audience opens the audience page in another device. As the story is told, the narrator can click on any image and it will be automatically shown on the audience's device. Every time there is a change of mood, the narrator can click on any playlist to change the music (it loops until changed/stopped). Moreover, some images can be marked as being \"maps\": when clicked, the narrator can uncover bits of it, and send the uncovered parts of the map to the audience. See the detailed example below for more information.\r\n\r\nInstalling Lyre\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nUnfortunately you need a server to run Lyre on. You can use your own\r\ncomputer, but you have to know how to make other devices connect to it\r\n(eg. find out your IP). Worst case scenario, you can use Lyre to play\r\nthe music.\r\n\r\nPlease see [Lyre's README file](https://github.com/emanchado/lyre#lyre) for the instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample\r\n-------\r\n\r\nLet's see how Lyre would be setup and used to run the scenario \"[The Merchant](http://hcoder.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The-Merchant.pdf)\" (PDF). First, we will identify the images in it: we have the Merchant's drawing, the split-leech drawing, the swamp map, the horrified face of Narre, the front drawing of the church, and the church map. We will divide them in three scenes: Intro (first image), The Hunting Starts (following three) and The Church (the other two). After creating the scenes and uploading the images, Lyre looks like this:\r\n\r\n![Preparing a story, step 1: scenes](images/lyre-prep1.png)\r\n\r\nSecond, the playlists. For this example we can create five playlists: Tavern, Swamp, Combat, Campsite, and Creepy Church. We could for example use the excellent tracks offered in TableTopAudio.com. After creating the playlists, Lyre will look like the image below (notice the playlists at the top):\r\n\r\n![Preparing a story, step 2: playlists](images/lyre-prep2.png)\r\n\r\nNow the story is ready to be narrated. Right before starting narration, the narrator loads Lyre in her laptop and clicks on the \"Narrate\" button. An address is shown on screen, then she grabs a tablet for the players and loads that address. That makes the tablet wait for images from the narrator's laptop, which will be shown as they are received.\r\n\r\n![Narration setup](images/lyre-narr1.png)\r\n\r\nWith the audience device and the narrator laptop prepared, the story starts. The narrator sees the list of available images and playlists, and sets the mood with some music by clicking on the _Tavern_ playlist:\r\n\r\n![Starting narration with music](images/lyre-narr2.png)\r\n\r\nShortly after, the narrator describes how _Opluk_ enters the tavern, and clicks on its drawing. The player's tablet immediately shows the picture:\r\n\r\n![Showing the first image](images/lyre-narr3.png)\r\n\r\nA bit later, the player characters are walking through a swamp. Narrator shows an initial map of the swamp (by clicking on \"Edit\" on the initial screen, clicking on the appropriate map, uncovering the appropriate parts on the map edit screen and clicking on \"Publish to audience\"). As the players keep walking, Narrator shows the more uncovered version of the map (by uncovering the necessary parts and clicking \"Publish to audience\" again).\r\n\r\nAfter hours of walking in-game, the characters find some abandoned clothes, and a stack of photographs in one of the pockets. Narrator shows the gallery with all photographs (by clicking on the appropriate album on the screen), which shows as a browsable gallery to the players.",
