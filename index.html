          <p>Say that you are a storyteller and you want an easy way to integrate images and music in your story. Especially if you like interactive stories (think "role-playing games"), Lyre can help you do it.</p>

<p>The basic premise is this: first, the narrator uploads the images she wants to show, grouped in scenes, and the audio tracks she wants to play, grouped in playlists. Right before telling the story, the narrator opens Lyre's narration page in her own computer and the audience opens the audience page in another device. As the story is told, the narrator can click on any image and it will be automatically shown on the audience's device. Every time there is a change of mood, the narrator can click on any playlist to change the music (it loops until changed/stopped). Moreover, some images can be marked as being "maps": when clicked, the narrator can uncover bits of it, and send the uncovered parts of the map to the audience. See the detailed example below for more information.</p>

<p>Unfortunately you need a server to run Lyre on. You can use your own
computer, but you have to know how to make other devices connect to it
(eg. find out your IP). Worst case scenario, you can use Lyre to play
the music.</p>

<p>Please see <a href="https://github.com/emanchado/lyre#lyre">Lyre's README file</a> for the instructions.</p>

<h2>
<a id="example" class="anchor" href="#example" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Example</h2>

<p>Let's see how Lyre would be setup and used to run the scenario "<a href="http://hcoder.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The-Merchant.pdf">The Merchant</a>". First, we will identify the images in the scenario. We have the Merchant's drawing, the split-leech drawing, the swamp map, the horrified face of Narre, the front drawing of the church, and the church map. We will divide them in three scenes: Intro, The Hunting Starts and The Church.</p>

<p>Second, the playlists. For this example we can create five playlists, each one with only one track downloaded from the excellent TableTopAudio.com.</p>

<p>With the audience device and the narrator laptop prepared, the story starts. Narrator is currently seeing the initial screen. Narrator sets the mood with some music (by clicking on the first playlist). Shortly after, Narrator describes one of the player characters and shows a picture of a portrait badge she carries (by clicking on the first image), which shows immediately on the audience device.</p>

<p>A bit later, the player characters are walking through a swamp. Narrator shows an initial map of the swamp (by clicking on "Edit" on the initial screen, clicking on the appropriate map, uncovering the appropriate parts on the map edit screen and clicking on "Publish to audience"). As the players keep walking, Narrator shows the more uncovered version of the map (by uncovering the necessary parts and clicking "Publish to audience" again).</p>

<p>After hours of walking in-game, the characters find some abandoned clothes, and a stack of photographs in one of the pockets. Narrator shows the gallery with all photographs (by clicking on the appropriate album on the screen), which shows as a browsable gallery to the players.</p>
